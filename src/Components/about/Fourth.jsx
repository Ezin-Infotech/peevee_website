        <p className='text-xl text-gray-500 font-light'>Founder Richard Pudlo concluded it was time to pursue his dream of starting a forwarding company after working for years as a freight forwarder with Harle Services (later renamed Panalpina), and organizing the international transportation of explosives and oilfield tools while employed at Halliburton in the 1980s. "I enjoy my job and the Halliburton people, but if I don't do this now, then I'll just get old and wonder if it would have ever succeeded," he said when he met with his divisional president at Halliburton and submitted his resignation.</p>
        <p className='text-xl text-gray-500 font-light my-5'>The response Pudlo received was, "We understand what you're trying to do, but we wish you would stay." We'll be there for you, and if things don't work out, you can have your job back. In light of this, PEEVEE was established on May 2, 1988, in Houston, Texas, and its first customer was "Halliburton Services – Vann Division" on that very day.</p> 
        <p className='text-xl text-gray-500 font-light'>After taking that initial leap of faith, Pudlo never looked back and worked hard to give his freight forwarders at Halliburton the kind of service he expected—that is, to "just treat the freight like it's your own." As clients and agency partners started to align themselves with PEEVEE, the general market soon learned to understand the meticulous attention to detail required to handle Halliburton's oilfield explosives. PEEVEE can now offer global transportation services and solutions because of their global network.</p>    */}
