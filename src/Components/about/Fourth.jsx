        <p className='text-xl text-gray-500 font-light'>After years of freight forwarding experience with Harle Services (which later became Panalpina), and coordinating the international transport of oilfield tools and explosives while at Halliburton in the ’80s, founder Richard Pudlo determined that the time was right to go forward with his desire to start a forwarding company. He met with his Halliburton divisional president, handed in his resignation and stated, “I enjoy my job and the Halliburton people, but if I don’t do this now, then I’ll just get old and wonder if it would have ever succeeded.”</p>
        <p className='text-xl text-gray-500 font-light my-5'>Pudlo was met with the words, “we wish you would stay, but we understand what you’re trying to do. We will support you, and if it doesn’t work out you can have your job back”. Consequently, ProCargo was founded in Houston, Texas on 02 May 1988; its first client on day one was “Halliburton Services – Vann Division”.</p> 
        <p className='text-xl text-gray-500 font-light'>From his early leap of faith, Pudlo never looked back, striving to provide the service he expected from his freight forwarders while at Halliburton, ie “just treat the freight like it’s your own”. The careful attention to detail required to move Halliburton’s oilfield explosives, soon came to be appreciated in the general market, as clients and agency partners began to align themselves with ProCargo. Today ProCargo’s network spans the globe, enabling them to provide worldwide transportation services and solutions.</p>
